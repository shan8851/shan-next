      <h2 className="card-title">Mike, software engineer</h2>
      <p>As someone learning web development from scratch I would not have been able to get to the position ready for a job in the industry without Shan&apos;s help. He has been patient and on-hand to help me through every stage of the process including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Github and more. He is incredibly knowledgeable in these areas and I cannot thank him enough for his support over the past 6 months.</p>
